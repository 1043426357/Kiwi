{"name":"Kiwi","tagline":"BDD for iOS and OS X","body":"### Kiwi\r\nKiwi makes Behavior Driven Development for iOS and OS X development simply pleasurable.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nThe idea behind Kiwi is to have tests that are more readable than what is possible with the test framework bundled with Xcode.\r\n\r\nTests (formally Specs) are written in Objective-C and are run within the comfort of Xcode to provide a test environment that is unobtrusive and seamless.\r\n\r\nSpecs look like this:\r\n\r\n```objective-c\r\ndescribe(@\"Team\", ^{\r\n    context(@\"when newly created\", ^{\r\n        it(@\"should have a name\", ^{\r\n            id team = [Team team];\r\n            [[team.name should] equal:@\"Black Hawks\"];\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        it(@\"should have 11 players\", ^{\r\n            id team = [Team team];\r\n            [[[team should] have:11] players];\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe [Kiwi Wiki](https://github.com/allending/Kiwi/wiki) is the official documentation source.\r\n\r\n### Getting it\r\nThe best way to get Kiwi is by using [CocoaPods](https://github.com/cocoapods/cocoapods).
